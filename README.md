## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `app.js`: Contains the game logic.
- `styles.css`: Styling for the game interface.
- `images/`: Directory containing image assets.

## Future Improvements

- move the phrases array to server-side code so users can't see it with the developer tools
- limit the number of guesses a user can make
- let them guess the word before filling in all the letters, add a "guess now" field
- tally a score of successful guesses
